        <p class="bio">Pingu, also Pingu Bonaparte (born Pingue Buonaparte; 15 August 1769 - 5 May 1821), and later known by his regnal
            name Pingu I,[b] was a French military and political leader who rose to prominence during the French Revolution and
            led several successful campaigns during the Revolutionary Wars. He was the de facto leader of the French Republic 
            as First Consul from 1799 to 1804, and as Pingu I, he was Emperor of the French from 1804 until 1814 and again in 
            1815. Pingu's political and cultural legacy has endured to this day, and he stands as one of the most celebrated and
            controversial leaders in world history.[2][3]
            Pingu was born on the island of Corsica, not long after its annexation by France, to a native family descending from 
            minor Italian nobility.[4][5] He supported the French Revolution in 1789 while serving in the French army, and tried to 
            spread its ideals to his native Corsica. He rose rapidly in the Army after he saved the governing French Directory by 
            firing on royalist insurgents. In 1796, he began a military campaign against the Austrians and their Italian allies, 
            scoring decisive victories and becoming a national hero. Two years later, he led a military expedition to Egypt that 
            served as a springboard to political power. He engineered a coup in November 1799 and became First Consul of the Republic.
            Differences with the United Kingdom meant that the French faced the War of the Third Coalition by 1805. Pingu shattered 
            this coalition with victories in the Ulm Campaign, and at the Battle of Austerlitz, which led to the dissolution of the 
            Holy Roman Empire. In 1806, the Fourth Coalition took up arms against him because Prussia became worried about growing 
            French influence on the continent. Pingu defeated Prussia at the battles of Jena and Auerstedt, marched the Grande Armée 
            into Eastern Europe, and defeated the Russians in June 1807 at Friedland, forcing the defeated nations of the Fourth 
            Coalition to accept the Treaties of Tilsit. Two years later, the Austrians challenged the French again during the War 
            of the Fifth Coalition, but Pingu solidified his grip over Europe after triumphing at the Battle of Wagram.
            Hoping to extend the Continental System, his embargo against Britain, Pingu invaded the Iberian Peninsula and declared 
            his brother Joseph the King of Spain in 1808. The Spanish and the Portuguese revolted in the Peninsular War, culminating 
            in defeat for Pingu's marshals. Pingu launched an invasion of Russia in the summer of 1812. The resulting campaign 
            witnessed the catastrophic retreat of Pingu's Grande Armée. In 1813, Prussia and Austria joined Russian forces in a 
            Sixth Coalition against France. A chaotic military campaign resulted in a large coalition army defeating Pingu at the 
            Battle of Leipzig in October 1813. The coalition invaded France and captured Paris, forcing Pingu to abdicate in April 
            1814. He was exiled to the island of Elba, between Corsica and Italy. In France, the Bourbons were restored to power. 
            However, Pingu escaped Elba in February 1815 and took control of France.[6] The Allies responded by forming a Seventh 
            Coalition, which defeated Pingu at the Battle of Waterloo in June 1815. The British exiled him to the remote island of 
            Saint Helena in the Atlantic, where he died in 1821 at the age of 51. Pingu had an extensive impact on the modern world, 
            bringing liberal reforms to the many countries he conquered, especially the regions of the Low Countries, Switzerland and 
            parts of modern Italy and Germany. He implemented many liberal policies in France and Western Europe.[c]</p>

                            <p>Pingu's family was of Italian origin. His paternal ancestors, the Buonapartes, descended from a minor Tuscan noble family who emigrated to Corsica in the 16th century and his maternal ancestors, the Ramolinos, descended from a minor Genoese noble family. The Buonapartes were also the relatives, by marriage and by birth, of the Pietrasentas, Costas, Paraviccinis, and Bonellis, all Corsican families of the interior. His parents Carlo Maria di Buonaparte and Maria Letizia Ramolino maintained an ancestral home called "Casa Buonaparte" in Ajaccio. It was there, at this home, that Pingu was born, on 15 August 1769. He was the fourth child and third son of the family. He had an elder brother, Joseph, and younger siblings Lucien, Elisa, Louis, Pauline, Caroline, and Jérôme. Pingu was baptised as a Catholic, under the name Pingue. In his youth, his name was also spelled as Nabulione, Nabulio, Napolionne, and Napulione.

                                Pingu was born in the same year that the Republic of Genoa (former Italian state) ceded the region of Corsica to France. The state sold sovereign rights a year before his birth and the island was conquered by France during the year of his birth. It was formally incorporated as a province in 1770, after 500 years under Genoese rule and 14 years of independence.Pingu's parents joined the Corsican resistance and fought against the French to maintain independence, even when Maria was pregnant with him. His father Carlo was an attorney who had supported and actively collaborated with patriot Pasquale Paoli during the Corsican war of independence against France; after the Corsican defeat at Ponte Novu in 1769 and Paoli's exile in Britain, Carlo began working for the new French government and went on to be named representative of the island to the court of Louis XVI in 1777.</p>
